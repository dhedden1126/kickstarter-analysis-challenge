# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Visualizing an Excel data set to analyze campaign outcomes based on launch dates & goals

### Purpose
To understand and strategize when the optimal time is to launch a campaign and formulating goals to improve success rates

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Potential challenges with the analysis include the following:
- converting data types
- leveraging Excel functions (countifs)
- visualizing the data with the correct chart or graph
- formulating meaningful conclusions with the analysis

## Results

- Optimal time frames for launching Theater campaigns will be in the months, May, June, and July 

- We can conclude as the campaign goals increase, the likelihood that a campaign fails increases. The exception is for the $35k-$45k goal range, where we saw an     increase in success rate.

- The highest failure rates for campaigns occurred when the goals were set $45k+. 

- The highest success rates for campaigns occurred when campaign goals were set at <$5k. 

- Limitations to this data include a lack of granular geographical, demographic, and income data for further understanding of who is contributing and what market. 

- Additional analysis could include pie charts with overall percentage of outcomes as a whole and by Category & Sub-category.
